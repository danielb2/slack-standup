    * dropping support for json. YAML makes more sense

    * threadding support

    regular lines have no bullets

    * but others do :smile:

    * everything is contained in one file. no more `_ts` file

    * now using <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slack/web-api|@slack/web-api>
    instead of deprecated <https://www.npmjs.com/package/request|request>
    package
  threading: |-
    if you just copy a link and  put it into the content of the yaml file
    under the `thread:` section, it will be threadded.
    for example
    ```
    thread: https://walmart.slack.com/archives/C5G525Q3U/p1599779930011400
    ```
  formatting: |-
    * newlines now get bullets when prefixed by *
    1. any number
    3. gets incremented
    * bullet between
    1. doesn't matter. should it ? that's tricky
